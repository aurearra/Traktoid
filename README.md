Traktoid
===================

An Android app powered by the [Trakt v2 API](http://trakt.tv/), [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).  
Unfortunately, Traktoid isn't available on the Playstore anymore as Google decided I didn't have the rights to display tv show and movie posters. Decision is final, I might try to resubmit it to the Playstore in the future but for now you can grab the [latest apk](https://github.com/florianmski/Traktoid/releases/latest) and [share your thoughts](https://plus.google.com/communities/113346133721976635769).
